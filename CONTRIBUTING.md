# Contribution guidelines:

## General guidelines:

* Abstract stuff like IP as much as you can, design code in such a way that minimum hardcoding is done inside the code

* Write all communication requests/responses in terms of RPC calls. We use gRPC for the same.


## To run the code

* Set up the required libraries

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
